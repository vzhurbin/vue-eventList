Testing out Vue
===============

Trying Vue through [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-app-with-vue-js-a-lightweight-alternative-to-angularjs).
Updated code to work with Vue 2 and some backend correctly

# Installation
Run npm install.
Run node server.js.
Visit http://localhost:8080.

# RESTful API
Use Node.js & Express for backend server and router.
RESTful requests towards the server to simulate CRUD on events model, instead of local hardcoded ones.
