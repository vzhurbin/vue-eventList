Trying Vue through [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-app-with-vue-js-a-lightweight-alternative-to-angularjs). Updated old code to Vue 2.

### Installation
`npm install`

`node main.js`

Open http://localhost:8080.

### RESTful API
1. Use Node.js & Express for backend server and router.
2. RESTful requests towards the server to simulate CRUD on events model, instead of local hardcoded ones.
